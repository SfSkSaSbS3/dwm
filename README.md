# Dwm

My version of suckless.org's dynamic window manager (https://suckless.org/dwm)

I really just made this repo so I can copy it over to other computers and VMs but you can use it if you want.

I suck at making descriptions.

You can build and install it yourself with:  
$ git clone https://github.com/sfsksasbs3/dwm  
$ cd dwm  
(as root) make install

Also consider reading the other README file.

No I did not update the man page.
